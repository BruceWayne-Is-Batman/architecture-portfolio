Experienced Network and Cloud Networking Architect with over 15 years in architectural roles and 23 years as a certified (and active) CCIE.

## [Architectural Philosophy](https://robert-n-myhre.github.io/architecture-portfolio/architectural-philosophy/)


I believe architecture is more than just diagrams—it’s about solving problems with clarity, scaling with intention, and supporting the teams who inherit what I design. I prioritize simplicity, reuse, collaboration, and alignment with real-world operations.
