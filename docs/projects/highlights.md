# Supporting Architecture Highlights

- **Led SD-WAN vendor evaluations** and architectural designs across multiple enterprises, providing executive-level recommendations balancing performance, cost, and roadmap alignment.  
- **Integrated Secure Service Edge (SSE)** into cloud and remote access strategies using Zscaler, aligning security policy with distributed access models.  
- **Authored cloud networking reference architectures** for AWS and Azure, enabling Solutions Architects to plug-and-play standard VPC/VNet designs into application blueprints.  
- **Designed resilient VPN architectures** spanning on-prem, cloud, and remote user access.  Building reusable patterns with active/standby failover, hub-and-spoke, and automated provisioning models.  
- **Embedded disaster recovery planning into all architecture phases**, ensuring failover testing and documentation were included in final design packages.  
- **Built foundational segmentation strategies** for wireless networks using SSID-to-zone mapping and peer-to-peer lockdown policies as a transitional model toward full SDA integration.
