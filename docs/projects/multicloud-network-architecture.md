# Multi-Cloud Connectivity Architecture via Megaport MCRs

**Role:** Network Architect  
**Industry:** Healthcare
**Status:** Completed  
**Key Technologies:** Megaport MCR, AWS Direct Connect Gateway, Azure VNet Gateway, BGP, NaaS, Multi-Cloud Routing

## Overview

The organization was building out a multi-cloud strategy with workloads across AWS and Azure. My role was to design a scalable and resilient connectivity architecture that would support both current and future cloud environments, while minimizing physical complexity and supporting strict uptime and latency requirements.

---

## Objective

- Establish cloud connectivity to AWS and Azure with **redundancy across two physical data centers**  
- Avoid the need for separate physical circuits for each cloud provider  
- Support future cloud region expansion without additional physical buildouts  
- Design a solution that balances **cost, performance, and failover capabilities**

---

## Approach

- Recognized that a **Network-as-a-Service (NaaS)** model was ideal for scalable multi-cloud connectivity  
- Evaluated five different vendors, organized product demos, and facilitated technical discovery sessions with internal engineering teams  
- Guided the selection process by seeking consensus from network engineers, while maintaining architectural direction  
- Selected **Megaport** using **Megaport Cloud Routers (MCRs)** in two cities ~300 miles apart for geographic diversity and failover

- Designed redundant 10Gbps connectivity to each data center using different service providers  
- Built BGP routing models connecting:
  - AWS via **Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW)**
  - Azure via **Virtual Network Gateway**
  - On-prem via dual MCRs with failover and traffic path control  
- Planned future expansion to additional cloud regions using **virtual circuits**, enabling spin-up in minutes without provisioning new physical hardware

---

## Outcome

- Delivered a **resilient, cloud-agnostic transport layer** between on-prem and public cloud  
- Provided full redundancy across data centers, transport providers, and cloud ingress points  
- Enabled fast, scalable expansion to additional cloud regions or platforms without reengineering  
- Positioned the organization for hybrid and multi-cloud agility with a simple, repeatable framework

## Lessons & Reflections

This was a standout example of architecture meeting business need: scalable, operationally simple, and cloud-ready. The collaborative vendor evaluation process helped build buy-in and confidence across the engineering team, and while automation wasnâ€™t immediately implemented, the architecture was designed with **future IaC integration in mind**.
