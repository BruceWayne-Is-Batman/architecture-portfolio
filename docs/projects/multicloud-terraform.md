# Azure Multi-Cloud Expansion with Terraform and AWS Pattern Alignment

**Role:** Cloud Networking Architect / Consultant  
**Industry:** SaaS / Cloud-Native Applications  

**Status:** Completed  
**Key Technologies:** Azure Hub-and-Spoke, Palo Alto NGFW, Terraform, Workspaces, Modules, AWS TGW

## Overview

A cloud-native client with a strong AWS foundation was expanding into Azure for specific application workloads. My role was to design the network architecture in Azure to align with their existing AWS hub-and-spoke model, while maintaining automation standards using Terraform. The goal was to ensure operational consistency, reduce ramp-up time for the team, and enable rapid scalability across clouds.

---

## Objective

- Extend AWS networking principles to Azure without disrupting Terraform-based workflows  
- Educate the internal team on Azure networking fundamentals and platform-specific nuances  
- Evaluate Azure-native options (including Virtual WAN) vs. custom design  
- Integrate Palo Alto NGFW in Azure to mirror AWS firewall architecture  
- Build reusable, Terraform-based infrastructure for the new Azure environment  
- Support the team through rollout and adoption

---

## Approach

- Began with **knowledge transfer sessions** to introduce the core concepts of Azure networking, such as zonal subnet behavior, route tables, and service endpoint design, to the internal networking team
- Conducted discovery sessions to understand application requirements, team workflows, and technical constraints  
- Evaluated Azure Virtual WAN but opted for a custom design based on cost and regional growth plans  
- Designed a custom Azure hub-and-spoke network model that closely matched AWS architecture, ensuring minimal cognitive load  
- Built Terraform modules following the clientâ€™s existing structure (variables, workspaces, naming conventions, etc.)  
- Handed off working infrastructure code and supported them through rollout and production readiness

---

## Outcome

- Delivered a working Azure hub-and-spoke network fully aligned with AWS practices  
- Integrated Palo Alto NGFWs for consistent security across environments  
- Empowered the team to expand into Azure without needing deep retraining  
- Established a foundation for repeatable, secure, and automated multi-cloud growth

## Lessons & Reflections

This project was a great example of combining cloud networking design with real-world NetDevOps alignment. While Terraform was familiar to the team, translating architectural principles between AWS and Azure required close collaboration and attention to subtle platform differences. The early investment in knowledge transfer helped ensure long-term ownership and adoption of the design.
