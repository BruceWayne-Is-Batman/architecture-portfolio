# Dual Data Center Architecture with Cisco ACI Multi-Pod

**Role:** Lead Network Architect  
**Industry:** Enterprise Manufacturing (Anonymized)  
**Status:** Completed  
**Key Technologies:** Cisco ACI Multi-Pod, Nexus 9000, BGP, Data Center Interconnect (DCI), Redundant 10Gbps Links

## Overview

This project involved designing and implementing a new data center strategy for a large enterprise migrating from a corporate on-premises data center to a co-located facility, while also standing up a fully redundant secondary site. My role was to evaluate, design, and lead the implementation of the new architecture, focusing on long-term scalability, resilience, and network segmentation.

---

## Objective

- Support physical relocation of the primary data center  
- Design a redundant, scalable network foundation for both primary and secondary sites  
- Ensure high availability and redundancy between data centers  
- Evaluate modern DC networking options and select best-fit solution  
- Build and deploy a vendor-aligned solution within tight timelines

---

## Approach

- Collaborated with infrastructure and application architects to define requirements and impact  
- Led analysis of traditional Core-Distribution-Access vs. Cisco ACI  
- Conducted technical and business evaluations with Cisco and internal stakeholders  
- Selected Cisco ACI Multi-Pod for scalability, policy abstraction, and future-proofing  
- Designed and deployed Multi-Pod fabric across two co-lo facilities in geographically diverse cities (~300 miles apart)  
- Worked with service providers to select transport based on latency, redundancy, and cost  
- Designed full OSPF routing between ACI fabrics and integrated with enterprise backbone

---

## Outcome

- Successfully deployed active data centers with high availability and redundancy  
- Achieved seamless extension of policy and segmentation across sites  
- Reduced future onboarding complexity through automation-ready fabric architecture  
- Gained valuable experience that enabled me to replicate the model in future projects across utilities, finance, and logistics industries

## Lessons & Reflections

This was my first end-to-end ACI Multi-Pod deployment, and I learned the architecture while leading the implementation. While initial configuration errors occurred, they were resolved without impacting operations. The project was a personal and professional growth milestone, solidifying my understanding of modern DC fabrics and large-scale interconnect.
