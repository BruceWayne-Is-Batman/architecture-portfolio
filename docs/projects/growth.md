# Actively Growing In

Architecture is never staticâ€”and neither is my mindset. While I bring deep experience in network and cloud architecture, I actively seek out opportunities to evolve my thinking, tools, and techniques. Here are a few areas Iâ€™m intentionally investing in right now:

---

## ðŸ”§ Observability & Monitoring Integration

While monitoring and logging are typically owned by operations, I'm learning how to architect systems with built-in observability considerations. Iâ€™m exploring ways to integrate telemetry and visibility into design handoffs, especially in cloud and fabric-based environments.

---

## ðŸ§© Cloud Security Architecture

As multi-cloud environments mature, Iâ€™m strengthening my understanding of security frameworks (like SSE, SASE, and ZTNA) and how they intersect with routing, segmentation, and policy enforcementâ€”especially when working with hybrid or decentralized teams.

---

## ðŸ›  Infrastructure Pipelines

I'm refining how I incorporate Terraform and Ansible into modular, reusable pipelines that can be easily adopted by operational teams. I'm exploring GitHub Actions and CI/CD for infrastructure deployments, particularly in multi-cloud environments.

---

## ðŸ“š Voice and Collaboration Technologies (High-Level)

While I partner with voice teams today, Iâ€™m building a stronger high-level understanding of UC architecture to better support end-to-end design conversations across all infrastructure domains.

---

## ðŸ§ª Lab-Driven Prototyping

I continue to expand my use of lab environments (CML, ProxMox, container labs) to simulate and validate complex designs before production. It also enables better collaboration with engineers during the evaluation and decision-making process.
